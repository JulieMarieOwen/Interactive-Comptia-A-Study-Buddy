<h1>AI: Interactive Study Buddy/h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I was a part of an intensive bootcamp experience for learning the CompTIA A+ objectives in order to get certified.  I created a study utility for both myself and the other members of the bootcamp to use to help prepare for the Core 1 and Core 2 Exams.  The goal was to ensure that the user would not only be able to see where they were struggling, but get explanations as to why the right answer is the right answer so that they would learn as they were utilizing the tool.

<h2>Considerations</h2>

I used OpenAI's Chat GPT to create my own GPT that would provide questions similar to those found on the test.  Some of the things I included in the study buddy were:

- <b>The option to choose the level of difficulty you are comfortable with: beginner, intermediate, expert so that users can confidently work their way up to expert while learning through the process</b>

- <b>The option to choose certain objectives to focus on or get mixed questions from all objectives</b>

- <b>The option to get two chances to get the right answer, and then an explanation of what the right answer is</b>
